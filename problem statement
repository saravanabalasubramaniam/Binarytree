A family has N members,each members has D age,each parents has 0,1 or 2 childs if they have two childs they dont know the age difference
so find the age difference between the each pair of childrens and print the minimum age difference of the childrens..(Binary search tree)
N=number of members in the family
D=age of each members
age<=1000
n<=1000


Positive Testcase :
                  Input:    N= 15
                            D=10 6 14 4 8 12 16 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17
                  Output:  minimum age difference: 2
Negative Testcase :
                  Input:    N=5
                            D=1 2 3 4 5
                  Output:   There is no two childs for same parent in the family
Positive Testcase :
                  Input:    N=7
                            D=6 4 8 2 5 7 11
                  Output:   Minimum difference is 3
Negative Testcase :
                  Input:    N=8
                            D=20 19 18 16 14 13 10 9
                  Output:   There is no two childs for same parent in the family
Positive Testcase: 
                  Input:    N=11
                            D=54 13 60 10 50 55 70 9 52 61 80
                  Output:   Minimum difference is 15
